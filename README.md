# Sematic_Segmentation using unet and its variants
This repository contains code for performing semantic segmentation on images using various UNet variants. The UNet architecture and its variants are widely used for accurate and efficient image segmentation tasks. In this project, we explore and compare the performance of the various UNet variants.
# Dataset
We use the CholecSeg8k dataset, which is a publicly available dataset for semantic segmentation in medical images. The dataset consists of a large number of annotated images depicting surgical scenes.
# Usage
Data Preprocessing: Before training the models, we perform data preprocessing steps, including loading the images and masks, resizing them to a consistent size, and converting the masks to label-encoded format.

Model Training: We train each UNet variant using the preprocessed data. The training involves optimizing the model's parameters using a suitable loss function and an optimization algorithm. We split the dataset into training and validation sets for model evaluation.

Model Evaluation: After training, we evaluate the performance of each UNet variant on the test set. We calculate various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the segmentation quality.

Comparison and Analysis: Finally, we compare the performance of the UNet variants based on the evaluation metrics. We analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each variant and provide insights into their effectiveness for semantic segmentation tasks.

# Conclusion
In this project, we explored and evaluated various UNet variants for semantic segmentation of medical images. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of these variants in accurately segmenting objects of interest. The results can guide researchers and practitioners in selecting the most suitable UNet variant for their specific segmentation tasks.
